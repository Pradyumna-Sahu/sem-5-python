# Write a program to compute sin(x) for given x. The user should supply x and a positive integer n. 
# We compute the sine of x using the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up to the term involving x‚Åø
# sin(x) = x - x3/x! + x5/5! - x7/7! + x9/9! ....

# Function to calculate factorial
def factorial(num):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact

# Input x and n
x = float(input("Enter the value of x (in radians): "))
n = int(input("Enter the highest power of x (n, odd positive integer): "))

# Initialize sum of series
sin_x = 0.0

# Sign variable to alternate + and -
sign = 1

# Loop over odd powers from 1 to n
for i in range(1, n + 1, 2):
    term = (x ** i) / factorial(i)
    sin_x += sign * term
    sign *= -1  # Alternate sign

# Display the result

# OUTPUT 
'''
Enter the value of x (in radians): 1.5708
Enter the highest power of x (n, odd positive integer): 9
sin( 1.5708 ) using series up to x^ 9 is: 1.0000000006627803
