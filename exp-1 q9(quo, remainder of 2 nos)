# Write a program to find Quotient and Remainder of two numbers

a = int(input("Enter dividend: "))
b = int(input("Enter divisor: "))
quotient = a // b
remainder = a % b
print("Quotient is", quotient)
print("Remainder is", remainder)

# OUTPUT
'''
Enter dividend: 20
Enter divisor: 3
Quotient is 6
Remainder is 2
'''
