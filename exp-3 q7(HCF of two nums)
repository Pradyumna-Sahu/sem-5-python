# Write a program that prompts the user to input two numbers and display its HCF The Highest Common Factor (HCF) 
# also called the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)oftwo whole numbers is the largest whole number that's a factor of both of them.

# Prompt user to enter two numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Store original numbers for display
a = num1
b = num2

# Euclidean Algorithm (Subtraction Method)
while num1 != num2:
    if num1 > num2:
        num1 -= num2
    else:
        num2 -= num1

# Print the HCF
print("HCF of", a, "and", b, "is", num1)

# OUTPUT 
'''
Enter first number: 36
Enter second number: 60
HCF of 36 and 60 is 12
