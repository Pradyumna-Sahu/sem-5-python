Imagine you start on the 3th floor of Atrium building, and then travel down to the 2nd floor, then back up to the 4th floor. 
You have travelled a total of 1+2=3 floors of distance. 
Given an array representing a series of floors you must reach by elevator, return an integer representing the total distance travelled for visiting each floor in the array in order. 
The Atrium building contains 6 floors [0 to 5]. A User only allowed pressing the lift buttons for 2-10 times to go to a floor.
''' 

floors = [3,2,4]
dist = sum(abs(floors[i]-floors[i-1]) for i in range(1,len(floors)))
print("Total distance:",dist)

# OUTPUT 
'''
Input: [3,2,4]
Output: Total distance: 3
