# Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer, It should then output a message indicating whether the number is a prime number.

# Prompt user to enter a positive integer

# Check if number is less than 2 (since 0 and 1 are not prime)
if num < 2:

'''
Enter a positive integer: 7
7 is a prime number.
