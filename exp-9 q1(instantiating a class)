'''
Python program to demonstrate instantiating a class.
An object is created which is basically a dog named Rodger. 
This class only has two class attributes that tell us that Rodger is a dog and a mammal.
''' 

classDog:
  # A simple class# attribute
  attr1 = "mammal"
  attr2= "dog"
  
  #A sample method
  def fun(self):
    print("I'm a", self.attr1)
    print("I'ma",self.attr2)

#Drivercode
if_name ==" main"
  # Object instantiation
  Rodger =Dog()

  #Accessingclassattributes
  # and method through objects
  print(Rodger.attr1)
  Rodger.fun()

# OUTPUT
