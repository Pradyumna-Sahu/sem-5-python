# Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end the program should display the largest and smallest numbers entered.

# Read the first number

# Initialize largest and smallest with the first number
largest = num
smallest = num

while True:

# Display the largest and smallest numbers
print("Largest number entered is:", largest)
