# Write a program to compute cosine of x. The user should supply x and a positive integer n. 
# We compute the cosine of x using the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up to the term involving x‚Åø
# cos(x) = 1 - x2/2! + x4/4! - x6/6! ....

# Function to calculate factorial
def factorial(num):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        fact *= i
    return fact

# Input x and n
x = float(input("Enter the value of x (in radians): "))
n = int(input("Enter the highest power of x (n, even positive integer): "))

# Initialize sum of series
cos_x = 0.0

# Sign variable to alternate + and -
sign = 1

# Loop over even powers from 0 to n
for i in range(0, n + 1, 2):
    term = (x ** i) / factorial(i)
    cos_x += sign * term
    sign *= -1  # Alternate sign

# Display the result
print("cos(", x, ") using series up to x^", n, "is:", cos_x)

# OUTPUT
'''
Enter the value of x (in radians): 1.5708
Enter the highest power of x (n, even positive integer): 8
cos( 1.5708 ) using series up to x^ 8 is: 3.673205103346574e-06
