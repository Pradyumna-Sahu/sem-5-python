'''
Python program to find all prime numbers up to N and store it in a list. Find the sum of the listed primes.
''' 

N = 20
primes = []
for n in range(2,N+1):
    if all(n%i!=0 for i in range(2,int(n**0.5)+1)):
        primes.append(n)
print("Primes:",primes,"Sum:",sum(primes))

# OUTPUT 
'''
Input: N = 20
Output: Primes: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] Sum: 77
