# Write a program which prompts the user to input principle, rate and time and calculate compound interest.

p = float(input("Enter principal: "))
r = float(input("Enter rate: "))
t = float(input("Enter time: "))
amount = p * (1 + r / 100) ** t
ci = amount - p
print("Compound Interest is", ci)

# OUTPUT
'''
Enter principal: 1000
Enter rate: 5
Enter time: 2
Compound Interest is 102.5
