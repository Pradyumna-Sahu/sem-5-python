A Spy has to send a secret message to the agency, which need to be encoded. 
The message is rearranged in a way that the odd numbered word shifted left one position 
and the even numbered word is shifted right one position. 
Write a python program to help the Spy create the secret message.

''' 

msg = "we are learning python"
words = msg.split()
res = []
for i, w in enumerate(words, 1):
    if i % 2 == 1:  # odd → shift left
        res.append(w[1:] + w[0])
    else:           # even → shift right
        res.append(w[-1] + w[:-1])
print("Secret message:", " ".join(res))

# OUTPUT
