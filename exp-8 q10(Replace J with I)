'''
Aditi has used a text editing software to type some text. After saving the
article as WORDS.TXT, she realized that she has wrongly typed alphabet
J in place of alphabet I everywhere in the article. Write a function JTOI()
in Python that would display the corrected version of entire content of the
file WORDS.TXT with all the alphabets "]" to be displayed as an alphabet
"I" onscreen.

def JTOI(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        text = f.read()
    print(text.replace("J", "I"))

JTOI("WORDS.TXT")

# OUTPUT
